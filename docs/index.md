# Heroku Provider

The Heroku provider is used to interact with the resources provided by Heroku
Platform API and needs to be configured with credentials before it can be used.

## Background

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a fully-managed platform that gives you the
simplest path to delivering apps quickly:

* [Using Terraform with Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-terraform-with-heroku)
* [Platform API reference](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference)
* [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

## Guides

* [Upgrading](guides/upgrading.html)

## Contributing

Development happens in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/heroku/terraform-provider-heroku):

* [Releases](https://github.com/heroku/terraform-provider-heroku/releases)
* [Changelog](https://github.com/heroku/terraform-provider-heroku/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
* [Issues](https://github.com/heroku/terraform-provider-heroku/issues)

## Example Usage

```hcl-terraform
# Configure the Heroku provider
provider "heroku" {
  email   = "ops@company.com"
  api_key = var.heroku_api_key
}

# Create a new application
resource "heroku_app" "default" {
  # ...
}
```

## Authentication

The Heroku provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for
authentication. The following methods are supported, listed in order of
precedence, and explained below:

* Static credentials
* Environment variables
* Netrc

### Static credentials

Credentials can be provided statically by adding `email` and `api_key` arguments
to the Heroku provider block:

```hcl-terraform
provider "heroku" {
  email   = "ops@company.com"
  api_key = var.heroku_api_key
}
```

### Environment variables

When the Heroku provider block does not contain an `email` or `api_key`
argument, the missing credentials will be sourced from the environment via the
`HEROKU_EMAIL` and `HEROKU_API_KEY` environment variables respectively:

```hcl-terraform
provider "heroku" {}
```

```shell
$ export HEROKU_EMAIL="ops@company.com"
$ export HEROKU_API_KEY="heroku_api_key"
$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
```

### Netrc

Credentials can instead be sourced from the [`.netrc`](https://ec.haxx.se/usingcurl-netrc.html)
file in your home directory:

```hcl-terraform
provider "heroku" {}
```

```shell
$ cat ~/.netrc
...
machine api.heroku.com
  login <your_heroku_email>
  password <your_heroku_api_key>
...
```

The directory containing the `.netrc` file can be overridden by the `NETRC` environment variable as described [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html).

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `api_key` - (Required) Heroku API token. It must be provided, but it can also
  be sourced from [other locations](#Authentication).

* `email` - (Required) Email to be notified by Heroku. It must be provided, but
  it can also be sourced from [other locations](#Authentication).

* `headers` - (Optional) Additional Headers to be sent to Heroku, as a string-encoded JSON object, 
  for example: `{"X-Custom-Header":"yes","X-Custom-Header-Too":"no"}`. If not provided, it will be 
  sourced from the `HEROKU_HEADERS` environment variable (if set).

* `customizations` - (Optional) Various attributes altering the behavior of certain resources.
  Only a single `customizations` block may be specified, and it supports the following arguments:

  * `set_app_all_config_vars_in_state` - (Optional) Controls whether the `heroku_app.all_config_vars` attribute
    is set in the state file. The aforementioned attribute stores a snapshot of all config vars in Terraform state,
    even if they are not defined in Terraform. This means sensitive Heroku add-on config vars,
    such as Postgres' `DATABASE_URL`, are always accessible in the state.
    Set to `false` to only track managed config vars in the state. Defaults to `true`.

* `delays` - (Optional) Delays help mitigate issues that can arise due to
  Heroku's eventually consistent data model. Only a single `delays` block may be
  specified, and it supports the following arguments:

  * `post_app_create_delay` - (Optional) The number of seconds to wait after an
    app is created. Default is to wait 5 seconds.

  * `post_space_create_delay` - (Optional) The number of seconds to wait after a
    private space is created. Default is to wait 5 seconds.

  * `post_domain_create_delay` - (Optional) The number of seconds to wait after
    a domain is created. Default is to wait 5 seconds.

* `timeouts` - (Optional) Define a max duration the provider will wait for certain resources
  to be properly modified before proceeding with further action(s). Only a single `timeouts` block may be specified,
  and it supports the following arguments:

  * `addon_create_timeout` - (Optional) The number of minutes for the provider to wait for an addon to be
  created/provisioned. Defaults to 20 minutes. Minimum required value is 10 minutes.
