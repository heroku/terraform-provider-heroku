# heroku\_space\_vpn\_connection

Provides a resource for creating a VPN connection between a network and a Heroku Private Space. For more information, see [Private Spaces VPN Connection](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/private-space-vpn-connection?preview=1) in the Heroku DevCenter.

~> **NOTE:** VPN connections are currently a beta feature that requires you email Heroku Support to have it enabled. Attempting to create a VPN connection without the feature enabled by Heroku Support will fail.

## Example Usage

```hcl
// Create a new Heroku space
resource "heroku_space" "default" {
  name         = "test-space"
  organization = "my-company"
  region       = "virginia"
}

// Connect the Heroku space to another network with a VPN
resource "heroku_space_vpn_connection" "office" {
  name           = "office"
  space          = "${heroku_space.default.name}"
  public_ip      = "203.0.113.1"
  routable_cidrs = ["192.168.1.0/24"]
}
```
